# Todo :

#### Important stuff :

I **MUST** do this to get a correct grade.

- [x] Check all todos in code
- [ ] Basic levels (in a chain)
- [x] Remove unneeded draw overrides
- [ ] Javadoc
    - [ ] animations
    - [ ] gui
    - [ ] sounds
- [ ] Optimization and bugshooting
- [ ] Uniformiser l'ordre de traitement des interractions
- [ ] Check particle system
- [ ] Recheck :
    - [x] Fireballs
    - [ ] Door
    
When everything works :
- [ ] Create a new branch `stable`
- [ ] Create a tag in `stable`
- [ ] Remove unused code from `stable`

And after, switch to BONUS STUFF in `master`.
When parts of the bonus stuff are stable and ready, we can merge them into `stable`.
